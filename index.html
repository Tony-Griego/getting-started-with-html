<h2>HTML</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
<li>Hyper Links = Link HTML Documents together (Makes up the internet)</li>
<li>The web was invented in the 1990s and has 30+ Billion Pages</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>HTTP -</b> The main protocol of the web<br>
<b>Servers -</b> Computers that host the files that make up the internet<br>
<b>Internet -</b> The world’s largest computer network<br>
<b>Browser -</b> Program that runs on your computer to display the files found on the internet.
</p>

<h2>Contnet</h2>
&lt;open tag&gt;Content&lt;/closing tag&gt; = This whole thing taken together is an “element.”<br>
&lt;a href=“url.com”&gt;anchor text&lt;/a&gt; = Creating a hyper link<br>
&lt;img src=“url” alt=“text”&gt; = Image (no closing tags [called a <b>"void tag”</b>])<br>
&lt;br&gt; a break tag (also a void tag)<br>
&lt;p&gt; tag = paragraph (requires closing tag)
</p>

&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;span&gt; <em>tags are used inline</em><br>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;form&gt; <em>tags are block</em><br>
<br>
<b>Container elements:</b> elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves.
<br>
<br>
<b>doctype</b> - tells browser what kind of document it is<br>
<b>head</b> = meta-data, java script, css<br>
<b>body</b> = content<br>
<p>
<h2>Web Pages</h2>
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
<u>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.</u> The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. 
Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct <b>"syntax”</b>).
<br>
<br>
For example, if you forget to close a &lt;b&gt; tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer then you can tell it to <u>do anything you want</u>
<br>
<br>
There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
<br>
<br>
You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
<br>
<br>
<b>Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag ( &lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag, (&lt;/p&gt;). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the &lt;br&gt; tag).
<br>
<br>
<b>Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br>
<br>
<b>Attribute:</b> This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write &lt;a href="www.udacity.com"&gt;
